    <h1>🟩⬛️🟩 HANNAH HUIKE ZHOU ⬛️🟩⬛️</h1>
<p>⚡️ I mainly focus on illustration and started to get interested in Neon Art, while trying different departments such as  print, fashion, production design,etc. My artist and research practice focuses on how can I express Japanese and Chinese mythical creature (their figures and their stories)back to the modern world with new mediums of art. My other part of an artist practical practice is to learn and try to master all different kinds of Chinese traditional instruments and bring them back to people's sight, and study different culture's, different country's traditional instruments.⚡️ </p>
<p>⚡️ I realized a phenomenon in the people in my parent's age, they tell their children to learn Western Classical Instruments from their childhood instead of learning Chinese traditional instruments even if they are going to school in China. My parents and my friends' all say that they think those children who learn and master Western Classical Instruments will get a better future than those who master Chinese traditional instruments. I know that is the truth the most conditions in China right now, with realizing that our high-school Chinese band has 5 performers that can go on stage whereas Western Classical Band has more than 20, and we are suffering from recruiting more members every year because there's no one to recruit.⚡️ </p>
